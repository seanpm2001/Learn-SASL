|| Project language file 1
|| For: seanpm2001/Learn-SASL
|| About:
|| I decided to make SASL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SASL) as SASL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SASL programming language. It only makes sense to SASL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
